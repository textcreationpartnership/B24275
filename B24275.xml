            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <l>And found his <hi>Winifred</hi> fiting there</l>
                  <l>Like an angel bright and fair:</l>

                  <l>And having in her hand a book,</l>
                  <l>She mildly thus reply'd again:</l>
                  <l>Sir <hi>Hugh,</hi> leave off to seek my love,</l>

                  <l>And take this answer once for all</l>
                  <l>With this sir <hi>Hugh</hi> to weep began,</l>
                  <l>And like a living funeral,</l>
                  <l>He went from thence both pale and wan,</l>
                  <l>And being full of grief and woe,</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Sea resolves to go.</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:4"/>
                  <l>And quickly he arriv'd in <hi>France,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Where traviling on to <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Fair Ladies did begin to glance</l>
                  <l>Vpon sir <hi>Hugh</hi> with wonton eye.</l>
                  <l>But yet he thought their Beauty rare,</l>
                  <l>Could not with <hi>Winifred</hi> compare.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And when to <hi>Venice</hi> once he came,</l>
                  <l>The Curtezans much love did shew,</l>
                  <l>To raise in him an amorous flame,</l>
                  <l>But they in vain the fire did blow:</l>
                  <l>For fitting like a male-content,</l>
                  <l>On <hi>Winifred</hi> his thoughts he bent.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nor could they win him by their art,</l>
                  <l>Which onely brought into his mind,</l>
                  <l>The love of her to whom his heart,</l>
                  <l>Like to a prisoner was confin'd,</l>
                  <l>For still these flames did freshly burn,</l>
                  <l>Which made him back again return.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And being now for <hi>England</hi> bound,</l>
                  <l>The Ship did sail with gentle winds,</l>
                  <l>Till by and by they quickly found,</l>
                  <l>That raging <hi>Neptune</hi> was inclin'd</l>
                  <l>To cast the Ship and all away:</l>
                  <l>Which made sir <hi>Hugh</hi> devoutly pray:</l>

               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:5"/>

                  <l>How the Emperours daughter Ursula,</l>
                  <l>with Crispine fell in love,</l>
                  <l>And were married by a Fryer:</l>
                  <l>and how the Emperour at last</l>
                  <l>Did of her choyce approve?</l>
                  <l>and granted their desire</l>
                  <l>And how the Shoo-makers with delight,</l>
                  <l>do sing on <hi>Chrispianus</hi> night.</l>
               </argument>
               <lg>
                  <l>WHen <hi>Maximinus</hi> ruled here,</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Crispine</hi> and his brother</l>
                  <l>Young <hi>Crispianus</hi> counsel'd were</l>
                  <l>By their most tender mother,</l>
                  <l>To travel forth into the Land,</l>
                  <l>That they might scape the Tyrants hand,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So being from their Mother gone,</l>
                  <l>The two young Princes went together,</l>
                  <l>Like two pretty Lambs alone,</l>
                  <l>Straying on they knew not whethet:</l>
                  <l>Vntil at last by chance they came,</l>
                  <l>Vnto a Town cal'd <hi>Feversham.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But as they travel'd on the way,</l>
                  <l>Being now come unto the Town:</l>
                  <l>Some Shoemakers by peepe of day</l>
                  <l>Vnto their work were now set down,</l>
                  <l>Who merrily did sit and sing,</l>
                  <l>As their work they did begin.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:9"/>
                  <l>These brothers knocked at the doore,</l>
                  <l>And for a service they did ask:</l>
                  <l>Telling them they were true but poor</l>
                  <l>For povertie is like a mask.</l>
                  <l>Which did their princely beauty hide,</l>
                  <l>Or else they would have been discryde.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Shoo-maker both and his wife,</l>
                  <l>Did like the pretty boyes right well:</l>
                  <l>And ask'd them of their former life,</l>
                  <l>While they a fained tale did tell:</l>
                  <l>But at the last short work to make,</l>
                  <l>They for their servants did them take.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus they unto their work did frame,</l>
                  <l>And pleased their Master so,</l>
                  <l>That he these brothers did maintaine,</l>
                  <l>That they no want did know.</l>
                  <l>Who in a little time did learn,</l>
                  <l>The trade, and did their living earne.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And now their masters fame was spread,</l>
                  <l>His Shooes was sent for farre and neere:</l>
                  <l>And t'was reported that he bred</l>
                  <l>His Iourney-men with love and feare:</l>
                  <l>So that he did often use,</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Court to send his Shooes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:9"/>
                  <l>It hapened that young <hi>Crispine</hi> came,</l>
                  <l>To bring some shooes unto the Court:</l>
                  <l>Where the Emperors daughter soon became</l>
                  <l>In love with him in earnest sort:</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Cupid</hi> with a powerful shaft.</l>
                  <l>Did mean to grace the Gentle-craft.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And having wounded thus her brest,</l>
                  <l>Fair <hi>Ursula</hi> did now begin,</l>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o be with pangs of love opprest:</l>
                  <l>But yet she knew not how to winne</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Crispine</hi> to her hearts desire,</l>
                  <l>Who durst not to her Love aspire.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet love did make her now grow bold,</l>
                  <l>And when he came with shooes again</l>
                  <l>Her love to him she did unfold:</l>
                  <l>Which quickly did his heart enflame,</l>
                  <l>Yet at the first he was amaz'd,</l>
                  <l>While he on her beauty gaz'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But yet at last he thus reply'd,</l>
                  <l>Madam, stuce you are inclin'd,</l>
                  <l>To make your self poor <hi>Crispines</hi> bride</l>
                  <l>I shall be glad to please your minde;</l>
                  <l>And here my faith to you I bow:</l>
                  <l>If my service you allow.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:10"/>
                  <l>This being said they both agreed,</l>
                  <l>That they should meet within the parke,</l>
                  <l>Where a blind Fryer with all speed,</l>
                  <l>Should marry them in the darke</l>
                  <l>The Fryer this knot had quickly tide,</l>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Uusula</hi> was <hi>Crispines</hi> bride.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And so the Fryer they did dismiss</l>
                  <l>And royally they did him pay:</l>
                  <l>That the poor Fryer he did wish</l>
                  <l>All joy unto their wedding day,</l>
                  <l>And that they might be a happy pair,</l>
                  <l>Free from sad annoy and care.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But now the place did them invite,</l>
                  <l>Being in the Park thus met,</l>
                  <l>For to tast of loves delight:</l>
                  <l>And while they were together set,</l>
                  <l>Vpon her Virgin wax he seal'd</l>
                  <l>The band of Love, which time reveal'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But now these lovers parted were,</l>
                  <l>Fair <hi>Ursula</hi> was pleased well:</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Crispine</hi> comming home did hear</l>
                  <l>The Iourney-men begin to tell:</l>
                  <l>How <hi>Crispianus</hi> was lately prest,</l>
                  <l>To be a Souldier with the rest,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:10"/>
                  <l>For <hi>Maximinus</hi> hath sent to <hi>France,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>An army of stout men and tall,</l>
                  <l>In war to try their doubtfull chance,</l>
                  <l>Against the <hi>Persian</hi> General,</l>
                  <l>Who meeting bravely in the field.</l>
                  <l>Both sides scorned much to yeeld,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How <hi>Crispianus</hi> get much fame,</l>
                  <l>And when the Prince of <hi>Gaules</hi> did fight,</l>
                  <l>With brave <hi>Iphricrates</hi> by name,</l>
                  <l>Who rescu'd him there in their fight,</l>
                  <l>And by his valour bore away,</l>
                  <l>All the glory of the day,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus nine moneths he abroad did spend,</l>
                  <l>But when once that time expir'd,</l>
                  <l>Fair <hi>Ursula</hi> did to <hi>Crispine</hi> send,</l>
                  <l>To have his counsel she required:</l>
                  <l>For now <hi>Ursula</hi> did feel</l>
                  <l>A Timpany with a double heel.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But <hi>Crispine</hi> with his dame did plot,</l>
                  <l>Entreating her for secrecy:</l>
                  <l>And so at last a place they got,</l>
                  <l>Where she might deliver'd be,</l>
                  <l>And here the Lady was brought a bed,</l>
                  <l>Who from her Fathers anger fled,</l>

               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:11"/>
                  <l>And just unto the Christning day,</l>
                  <l>Come <hi>Crispianus</hi> back again,</l>
                  <l>VVho long in <hi>France</hi> had been away,</l>
                  <l>And there had gotten endlesse fame.</l>
                  <l>Thus every thing did hit out right,</l>
                  <l>To increase joy and delight.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Aftet this same day was past,</l>
                  <l>Being spent in mirth and sport,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Crispianus</hi> did make hast,</l>
                  <l>VVith his letters to the Court,</l>
                  <l>VVhich when the Emperour did view,</l>
                  <l>VVith wonder he astonisht grew.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And <hi>Crispianus</hi> he did commend,</l>
                  <l>Taking a jewel from his neck,</l>
                  <l>VVhich he only did intend,</l>
                  <l>That he himself therewith might deck:</l>
                  <l>Thus it was <hi>Crispianus</hi> chance,</l>
                  <l>That the wars should him advance.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But this being past and done:</l>
                  <l>News was to the Emperour brought,</l>
                  <l>That his daughter was newly come,</l>
                  <l>For whom before they had so sought:</l>
                  <l>And gave the Emperour to understand</l>
                  <l>That a Shoo-maker led her by the hand,</l>

               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:11"/>
                  <l>The Emperour did them welcome make,</l>
                  <l>And welcom'd <hi>Crispine</hi> too by name</l>
                  <l>Bidding young <hi>Crispianus</hi> take</l>
                  <l>His daughter to advance his fame.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Ursula</hi> did the same deny,</l>
                  <l>And to her Father thus reply.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Crispine</hi> sayes she deserves my love,</l>
                  <l>Although a Shoo-maker be seem,</l>
                  <l>Of him I always will approve,</l>
                  <l>And now to marry him I mean,</l>
                  <l>Dear father look upon this boy,</l>
                  <l>VVhich I do hope will prove your joy.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And so <hi>Crispines</hi> Dame did bring</l>
                  <l>VVithin her armes the pretty child,</l>
                  <l>And dandling it began to sing,</l>
                  <l>VVhile that the Infant sweetly smil'd,</l>
                  <l>Yet though it lookt with cheerfull eyes,</l>
                  <l>The Emperour did the have dispise.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But when that once he knew,</l>
                  <l>His Daughter was the Mother:</l>
                  <l>And that <hi>Crispine</hi> then in view</l>
                  <l>VVas <hi>Crispianus</hi> brother,</l>
                  <l>The Emperour greatly did rejoyce,</l>
                  <l>And confirm'd his daughters choyce.</l>

               <lg>
                  <pb facs="tcp:207508:12"/>
                  <l>Then there was joy and triumph great,</l>
                  <l>And the story here doth say,</l>
                  <l>The Shoo-makers did leave their seat,</l>
                  <l>And did make it holy-day.</l>
                  <l>And Poets did new masks invent,</l>
                  <l>For the Emperors merriment.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And afterward still every year,</l>
                  <l>Vpon that day at night,</l>
                  <l>The Shoo-makers do make great cheer,</l>
                  <l>With solace and delight,</l>
                  <l>This day doth light still in <hi>October</hi>
